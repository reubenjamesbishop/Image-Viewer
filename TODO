IDEAS / TO DO:

		
	CURRENT PLAN

		- Calculate distance to the wall in the camera view
		- Simple if/else block to determine which array of images to load into the box
		- Constantly refresh which texture to load in update loop

	- Fix controls (Especially zoom controls)

		- Calculate the yaw and pitch angle (alpha/beta)
		- Use same zoom method but zoom with cos() and sin() of alpha/beta
		- Align W/A/S/D/up/down with current camera view ( THREE.FirstPersonControls()? / FlyControls()? )

	- Split cube faces into grids, and load tiled images in parts to the face

	- Investigate LOD for image textures rather than just mesh structures

	- Stretch the box based on user input to a greater size to zoom?  


NOTE:

		To load local images, need to run a terminal script with python

				> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

				Then in the browser use localhost:8000
